Product Sales Data Analysis
 
Businesses must keep detailed records of their sales for a variety of reasons. However, if there is too much data, it often becomes difficult to keep track of everything. Analyzing sales data allows companies to keep track of their sales and answer all critical questions regarding their performance.

Dataset: Microsoft's sample dataset. 

Project Idea: This sales data analysis project explores analyzing a company's sales data and indicating profit by product, sales, and other significant factors that might influence the company's performance. Hereâ€™s how you can approach the analysis:

Use bar and column charts to identify products with the highest and lowest profit margins.

Leverage heatmaps and point maps to track sales performance across different geographies.

Use line charts to analyze seasonal trends in sales and profitability over time.

Segment products into categories and visualize sales performance to identify strong and weak areas.
